Here's a summary of the output:

**Optimization Techniques for Large Language Models**

* Optimization techniques include linear warmup and decay schedule, batch sizes, learning rates, hyperparameter tuning, weight decay, dropout, and gradient descent.
* Gradient descent variants (e.g. Adam) are also used.
* Batch normalization is effective for stabilizing training of large language models.

**Pre-training Techniques**

* Adding more data (500k steps) improves performance on some tasks.
* Pre-training a model longer (300k or 500k steps) also improves performance on some tasks.
* Using larger pre-trained models (e.g. BERT) can lead to better results.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**

* Hyperparameter tuning can improve performance, including:
	+ Number of layers
	+ Hidden size
	+ FNN inner hidden size
	+ Attention heads
	+ Dropout rates
	+ Warmup steps
	+ Peak learning rate
	+ Batch size
	+ Weight decay
	+ Max steps
* Learning rate decay is typically linear.

**Hyperparameter Variations**

* Different hyperparameters are used for different models, including:
	+ RoBERTa LARGE and RoBERTa BASE
	+ RoBERTa LARGE on RACE
