3,"Here is a summary of the text in bullet points:

**Pre-training**

* Pre-training involves training a model on large amounts of unlabeled text data to learn general language knowledge
* The goal of pre-training is to learn universal sentence representations that can be applied across multiple tasks
* Techniques used for pre-training include:
	+ MaskGAN: uses pre-training to improve text generation capabilities
	+ Sentence encoding: learns distributed representations of sentences from unlabelled data
	+ Gaussian error linear units (GELUs): bridge nonlinearities and stochastic regularizers in NLP models

**Fine-tuning**

* Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset with labeled data
* The goal of fine-tuning is to leverage the knowledge gained during pre-training and adapt it to a particular NLP task
* Techniques used for fine-tuning include:
	+ Concatenating representations from top four hidden layers without fine-tuning any parameters
	+ Feature-based approach: extracts activations from one or more layers without fine-tuning BERT parameters, using them as input to a BiLSTM before classification
	+ Fine-tuning the entire model yields better results than a feature-based approach

**Pre-training procedures**

* Use large amounts of unlabelled text data (e.g., one billion words) to learn general language patterns
* Pre-training can be used for semi-supervised sequence modeling, where the model is trained on both labelled and unlabelled data from different sources
* Multitask learning can be used to improve performance on multiple related tasks simultaneously by sharing knowledge across tasks

**Fine-tuning procedures**

* Adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset with labeled data
* Use techniques such as:
	+ Weighted sum of last four hidden layers
	+ Concatenation of last four hidden layers
	+ Feature-based approach: extracts activations from one or more layers without fine-tuning BERT parameters, using them as input to a BiLSTM before classification

**Common goals**

* Leverage the knowledge gained during pre-training and adapt it to a particular NLP task
* Improve performance on multiple related tasks simultaneously by sharing knowledge across tasks
* Use techniques such as semi-supervised sequence learning, multitask learning, and supervised learning of universal sentence representations."
4,"Here is a summary of the provided text in bullet points:

**Pre-training procedures**

* Pre-training involves exposing the model to large amounts of text data
* Different masking procedures are used in pre-training, such as:
	+ Random masking (50% of tokens masked)
	+ Word-piece masking (15% uniform masking rate)

**Training hyperparameters**

* Adam optimizer with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999
* Batch size: 256 sequences (128,000 tokens/batch)
* Number of epochs: approximately 40 over a 3.3 billion word corpus
* Dropout probability: 0.1 on all layers

* Trained on multiple Cloud TPUs, but specifics not provided for BERTLARGE
* Pre-training of BERTLARGE was performed on 16 Cloud TPUs with a total of 64 TPU chips.
* Each pre-training took 4 days to complete.

**Fine-tuning**

* Model hyperparameters were mostly the same as in pre-training, with exceptions including:
	+ Batch size: adjusted for specific fine-tuning tasks
	+ Learning rate: adjusted for specific fine-tuning tasks
	+ Number of training epochs: adjusted for specific fine-tuning tasks"
5,"Here are the summaries of the pre-training and fine-tuning procedures for NLP models in concise bullet points:

**Pre-Training Procedures:**

* Pre-training involves training a model on a large corpus of text, such as the BookCorpus and Wikipedia.
* Fine-tuning can be performed on specific tasks or domains, allowing the model to adapt to new data distribution.
* The BERT model's pre-training includes three stages: (1) next sentence prediction (NSP), (2) sentence classification, and (3) word prediction.
* Other tasks include single-sentence classification (e.g. SST-2, CoLA), question paragraph classification, and start/end span detection.

**Fine-Tuning Procedures:**

* Fine-tuning can be performed on the entire BERT model or on specific parts of it, such as the CLS token.
* The goal is to predict whether an English sentence is linguistically ""acceptable"" or not.
* Benchmark datasets include STS-B, MRPC, RTE, and WNLI.

**Pre-training Convergence:**

* MLM pre-training convergence is slower than LTR pre-training due to only predicting 15% of words per batch.
* MLM model outperforms LTR model in absolute accuracy after a short period.

**Fine-tuning Strategies:**

* Using the MASK strategy during fine-tuning can be problematic, especially with feature-based approaches.
* RND strategy performs worse than the proposed strategy.

**Feature-Based Approach:**

* Feature-based approach involves concatenating last 4 layers of BERT as features.
* This approach is robust to different masking strategies."
